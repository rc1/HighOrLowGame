# High or Low Game

A quick, **dirty**, and ugly exportation of:

1. Open WC typescript, LitElement, Web Components starter app project generator. Often a little verbose to explore all the key concepts and approaches of the generator template. Quick dip into Web Audio and Streams API. 
2. A game designed to help my kids articulate the concept of higher or lower pitch in sound. As a child, no one explained this to me, and I remember not being offered music lessons at a Scottish primary school ðŸ¥² simply because I couldn't yet match the words to the concept.
3. It is not that great a game... so I will leave as is. 
4. It is made it for my mobile screen.
5. It talks (one kid is to young to read).

## Open-wc Starter App

[![Built with open-wc recommendations](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-open--wc-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-wc)

## Quickstart

To get started:

```sh
npm init @open-wc
# requires node 10 & npm 6 or higher
```

## Scripts

- `start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `test` runs your test suite with Web Test Runner
- `lint` runs the linter for your project

## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.
